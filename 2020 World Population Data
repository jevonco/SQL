With this dataset, I was interested in finding trends in regard to where individuals were moving from/to in 2020. 
I use aggregae functions, CASE, IN, subqueries, comparison operators, LIMIT & GROUP BY


Countries and dependent territories, 2020 Data 
Adapted from
 http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/
 Does not include rows which had "N.A." values; some territories are missing.

/*What is the average population change over one year globally?*/
SELECT AVG(percent_one_year_change)
FROM countries; 

/*Which country has the largest population?*/
SELECT name, MAX(population) AS total_population
FROM countries;

/*Which country has the smallest population?*/
SELECT name, MIN(population) AS total_population
FROM countries;

/*Which country has the highest population change? Did they experience net positive/negative population change?*/
SELECT name, MAX(population_change), net_migrants
FROM countries; 

/*Which country has the lowest popultion change? Did they experience net positive/negative population change?*/
SELECT name, MIN(population_change), net_migrants
FROM countries; 

/*Which countries experienced a net positive, negative, and 0 change in populations?*/
SELECT
name, 
net_migrants,
CASE 
WHEN net_migrants < 0 then "Negative"
WHEN net_migrants > 0 then "Positve"
Else "Net 0"
END "Growth"
FROM countries; 

/*What is the average age globally?*/
SELECT AVG(median_age)
FROM countries; 

/*Which countries experienced a net negative change with a median_population less than or equal to the global average age?*/
SELECT name, net_migrants, median_age
FROM countries 
WHERE net_migrants < 0
AND median_age <= 30;

SELECT name, net_migrants,population
FROM countries
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*Which countries has the highest number of net migrants?*/
SELECT name, MAX(net_migrants)
AS net_growth
FROM countries 
WHERE net_migrants > 0; 

/*Are there any relationships between population, population density, and net migration changes?*/
SELECT name, population, density_per_sq_km, net_migrants
FROM countries
WHERE name 
IN 
(SELECT name FROM countries ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 10)
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 10;
