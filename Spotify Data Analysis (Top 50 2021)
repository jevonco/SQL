I developed different business scenarios/questions for a data set of the top 50 spotify songs from 2021 and used SQL to find the insights/answers.
I use CASE, CAST, CTES, and aggregate functions. 

/*How many artist appear more than once in the Top 50 songs? How many times?*/

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
GROUP by artist_name
HAVING COUNT(artist_name) > 1; 
--10 artist appear; 7 of 10 only appear twice; Olivia Rodrigo & Doja cat both appear 4 times

/*What is the average popularity score for the artists in the database?*/

SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM bit_db.spotifydata;
--86.6

/*Which artists have an average popularity score of 90 or higher - label them as tops stars so they can be featured on the homepage?*/
WITH popularity_CTE AS
(
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90; 

/*What is the most popular key amongst the top 50 songs*/
SELECT song_key, COUNT(song_key) AS frequency
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
GROUP BY song_key
ORDER BY COUNT(song_key)
DESC;
--Most popular key in order are C# (pitch class notation)

/*Are the most popular songs typically in the major or minor mode (happier or meloncholy)?*/
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(song_mode)
    FROM bit_db.spotifydata
    WHERE song_mode = 1)
/CAST(COUNT(song_mode) AS FLOAT) AS major_mode_percentage
FROM bit_db.spotifydata; 
-62% of the top songs are in the major mode

/*Create a playlist for those who want to dance to the top 50 songs*/

SELECT track_name, artist_name, id
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability
DESC
LIMIT 10; 
--Song IDs in order 46,36,39,48,25,43,14,42,21,41

/*Create new playlist options for new listeners featuring Spotify's top 50 songs from 2022*/

SELECT artist_name, track_name,
    CASE 
    WHEN tempo < 100 THEN 'Chill Vibes'
    WHEN tempo > 100 AND tempo < 130 THEN 'Social Hour'
    WHEN tempo > 130 THEN 'Party Time!'
    END Playlist
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
ORDER BY playlist; 

/*How many songs are in each playlist?*/

SELECT COUNT(track_name) AS number_of_track,
    CASE 
    WHEN tempo < 100 THEN 'Chill Vibes'
    WHEN tempo > 100 AND tempo < 130 THEN 'Social Hour'
    WHEN tempo > 130 THEN 'Party Time!'
    END Playlist
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
GROUP BY playlist
ORDER BY playlist;
--13 Chill, 17 Party Time!, 20 Social Hour
