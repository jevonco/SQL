With this code, I use SQL to find insights into the content available on Netflix. I use pattern matching, CAST, JOINs, and subqueries.

1. /*What percentage of the Netflix catalog is movies?*/

SELECT
ROUND
(CAST
((SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type ILIKE 'movie') AS NUMERIC)
/
(SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"),2)
AS movies;

2. /*Who are the top 5 directors with the most titles in the Netflix Catalog?*/

SELECT director, COUNT(title)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE director IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY director
ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC;

3. /*Which directors were behind each title in the United States?*/

SELECT  people.show_id, director, title, type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE director IS NOT NULL
AND country ILIKE 'United%'
ORDER BY director;

4. /*What is the oldest movie/TV Series in the Netflix Catalog?*/

SELECT title,type,release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE release_year
= (SELECT MIN(release_year)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info");
