In this analysis, I developed a few questions and used SQL to find the answers. I also include a few examples of exploratory analysis using SQL.

/*Which street has the highest average saefty rating?*/

/*Which city has the lowest average safety rating?*/

/*Based on the safety ratings given by two auditors, make recommendations to the city
on which bike lanes should be removed, improved, and left as is.*/

WITH bike_lane_cte AS 
    (SELECT street, safetyrating, 
    AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) AS average_safety_rating
    FROM citybikelanes
    ORDER BY street)
SELECT street, safetyrating, average_safety_rating, 
    CASE 
    WHEN average_safety_rating >= 4 THEN 'Leave As-Is'
    WHEN average_safety_rating <=2.5 THEN 'Remove'
    ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
    END Recommendation
FROM bike_lane_cte
ORDER BY recommendation;

--Exploratory Analysis: The bike lanes have been installed periodically over the past 20 years.
--I am querying the table to uncover trnnds in the table; specifically in how the the lanes installed before and after 2010 compare.

SELECT AVG(safetyrating)
FROM CityBikeLanes
WHERE year_installed < 2010;
--4.64

SELECT AVG(safetyrating)
FROM CityBikeLanes
WHERE year_installed > 2011;
--4.07
